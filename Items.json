Those words become true and the target acts as though affected by the {@spell geas} spell. The target can be written upon multiple times, creating a series of soul-binding instructions that each act as a unique instance of the {@i geas} spell. If the creature is targeted with a {@i remove curse} spell, only one of the writings is removed each time. "
