The Exile now wanders the world it has been cast upon, appearing as a shimmer of light. Its goal is known only to those whom it trusts, and it grants power to them as it is powerless itself, stripped of interaction with the mortal world for its hubris. It endlessly searches, seeking either a soul of great kindness to help it find the knowledge and power to resurrect its fallen paramour or one unscrupulous enough to wage war upon the very stars themselves. The light shines, but that fire can be cold and merciless, like the wrath of a love destroyed."

Able to track down even the most obscure sources of information, they act as invaluable allies to the archivists.

When the master of a record-hunter dies, it will return to the Archive and begin a grim and emotionless work. The record-hunter will unfold itself, revealing the countless layers and pages within its body, all covered in the secrets that it has revealed. It will then begin to tear itself apart, silently writhing in agony as it binds itself into a book or scroll.",
					"The new tome of secrets will be picked up by the other record-hunters and placed with reverence upon the shelves of the Archive, and a new record-hunter will be manufactured from blood, ink, and eldritch parchment. It is in this way that the Accursed Archive grows and spreads, constantly seeking new archivists to carry its record-hunters forth. The Silent One acts in defiance of these strange constructs, guarding the knowledge of the Archive while acting in a way that will discourage future additions to the collection. Once a written work is within the Archive, it cannot be destroyed.",
					"Those who take forbidden tomes from the Archive or bear weapons covered in dark script often act in different capacities, either spreading ruin directly or seeking out ancient writings that have managed to somehow escape the attentions of the Archive."

They are birthed from the pyres of creatures sacrificed to the Ashen Wolf, yet they are often friendly and pleasant to mortals. When provoked, they unleash a blast of ash and smoke before closing in with teeth like red-hot pokers. When at rest, they often sleep within fireplaces and other areas where fires are commonly stoked. They feast on raw meat whenever the opportunity presents itself, and enjoy being presented with gifts of metal and rare wood, as they enjoy devouring both in large quantities.",

There are no reliable records that can prove this belief, but as intelligent elementals they are capable of speech and can thus be asked. As an emberborn feeds and ages, they will grow larger and larger. Some eldritch scholars hypothesize that the Ashen Wolf was once an emberborn, strangely enough.",
					"When summoning an emberborn deliberately, a brazier filled with wood and rare metal is presented and the blood of a sacrificed beast is poured over the open flame as the summoner performs the eldritch incantation. The fire will burn quickly, and when it is reduced to coals, the emberborn will begin to take shape. It will emerge from the fire and demand to be fed. If the summoner provides a drop of their blood to the newly born beast without hesitation, then the emberborn will smile and swear loyalty to their new master. If the summoner does not, then the emberborn will vanish into smoke and seek a forest to ignite instead."

They can change their appearance quite dramatically as suits their mood, and tend to try to occupy picture frames or the exteriors of statues whenever possible.",
						"The creation of an animate image is an unusual one, directly related to the art of shadow puppetry. While images can be of any color or form, they are simple when first created. The artist must stand before a burning brazier and establish an eldritch connection with the flame, calling upon it to cast light more fervently. Once done, they will place their hands on the far side of the fire, casting a shadow on the wall or ground. While chanting the eerie words and phrases required by this mystical rite, they will use their hands to make a shadow puppet. The chanting corresponds with a story fitting for the personality of the animate image that they desire to summon.",
						"A story of loss and betrayal will call forth an image that takes the shapes of monsters and assassins, while a pleasant story with happy ending will create one that is more mischievous than hateful. Over the course of the ritual, the shadow puppet will solidify, no longer moving with the hands of the artist. At the culmination of the event, the warlock will cut a fingertip and place a single drop of blood on the shadow, infusing it with life, soul, and obedience to its creator."

						" Dimcats speak in a wide variety of voices and have many strange and enigmatic personalities, but most can be described as one might expect: haughty, overbearing, demanding, sly, clever, charming, affectionate, enigmatic, mysterious, deceptive, curious, and practically any other term one might use to describe an actual cat."

						"The eyeless watcher is a tentacled horror with small wings that speaks in whispers, often repeating the grimmest word it has most recently heard. A new one is born with each secret the Keeper of the Depths learns, and they emerge from the deep dreams of its mind to grace the mortal world with their presence. The watchers are praised and reviled for their unceasing usefulness, but their tentacles bear a poison far deadlier than their servitude.  ",
						"They enjoy causing fear and concern, but seem to do so out of habit more than any actual malice. When at rest, they tend to immerse themselves in water, and flutter their tendrils out to the edges of whatever body of water they have occupied. Most are seemingly brilliant to the minds of ordinary mortals, and whisper secrets from worlds and lifetimes beyond those of any who are present now. They have an interesting rivalry with the Archive's record-hunters, and seek to safeguard their secrets from being cataloged in such a mundane fashion as literature. Instead, they hold oral traditions as the highest form of knowledge, and seek to share them in the dreams they visit on the nights of a full moon.",
						"These horrors are suspected to have been first created as the result the work of the Keeper's first collection: a series of ancient artifacts found buried within the ruins of a civilization lost to the tides upon a distant world. With these, it called the seas to rise above the land and swallow the entire planet, though the artifacts were destroyed in the process. Countless thousands died that day, and those that remained lived among the corpses and the surf amidst the highest mountaintops. Over time, the Keeper's unshakable influence over the world grew ever greater, twisting once noble folk into imitations of themselves. They performed rituals over the dead, taking the flesh of their fallen and consuming it themselves. They offered their broken bodies and minds to the Keeper, and it grew ever more powerful.",
						"In the end, it discovered that hearing the whispers of those who worshiped it was pleasing, and so it turned its mind to the lost and ancient arts that allowed one to sculpt life from flesh and sentience from dreams. Thus, the eyeless watchers were born, forever whispering the secrets of those who have come and gone for the entertainment of their inhuman master."

						"The harrowing hawk is a large bird with stone-cold eyes that is infused with merciless ice. Bred as hunting birds by the Wild Huntsman, these creatures are far deadlier than their cruel visage belies. When they swoop down to attack their prey, they freeze the edges of their wings and slash with the ice-coated feathers, leaving the frost in the wound to slow their victim. As the ice builds, they let out a piercing cry to summon their master to strike down the target from afar. When at rest, they tend to rest upon the shoulders of their masters and gaze menacingly at those around them. They enjoy gifts of carved bone and scrimshaw, which they use to make their nests, and feast upon frozen meat with gusto.",
						"Harrowing hawks are typically solitary creatures, and rarely cooperate with one another while hunting prey. However, mated pairs are known to hunt together to devastating effect, with one scouting for the other, finding an enticing meal, then letting out a shrill cry. Before the prey can react, the second crashes down with the force of a thunderbolt, slaying the beast instantly. Then the two will perch upon the body until the snow has taken the heat from it, beginning their feast when the blood begins to freeze.",
						"When in the service to a warlock aligned to the Huntsman, they serve as scouts and harbingers to the hounds who pursue the prey, seeking to drive them into the clutches of their master. They have a strong bond with the other beasts of the Huntsman's stable, though are haughty and typically view themselves as the most favored of beasts. The steeds may carry, and the hounds may enjoy the master's affections, but the hawks were the first, and the hawks will be the last. Their pride will lead them to seemingly impossible feats of nighsuicidal bravery, such as tearing the eyes from sorcerers and diving down the throats of dragons to cleave about with their razor-sharp wings."

						"The imperial cobra is one of the deadliest venomous snakes, and their bloodline has been infused with the magic of the Serpent Empress, granting them speech and cunning. Hatched from a long lineage bred to be spies, assassins, and assistants to courtiers, these cobras are malicious and devious. Their venom is potent and infused with powerful magic that enables it to harm even those protected against such toxins. When at rest, they seek out small animals, such as rats or birds, and torment them for entertainment, gradually injecting small amounts of venom until the creature dies in horrible agony. These cobras enjoy flattery as well as games of wit and chance, and gleefully accept gifts of precious gemstones, jewelery, mirrors, exotic meats, and eggs from reptiles and birds alike.Summoning an imperial cobra is easier said than done. The proper incantations and utterances are difficult to pronounce without a forked tongue, and so it is rarely done by any who are not servants of the Empress. As the ritual proceeds, the summoner must inscribe a small, fang-shaped mark upon their hand before holding it over the fire of a brazier, offering it to the cobra. The beast will emerge from within the fire initially as a serpent of green flame, coiling and hissing with malicious intent. The flaming snake will strike at the offered hand, burning a thin line through the inscribed fang. If the summoner remains calm and still through this process, they will succeed in the rite, gifting the serpent with life and causing it to become corporeal. If they express emotion or pain, then an agonizing toxin will flood their veins and the ritual will be disrupted.",
						"Most servants of the Empress will offer the imperial cobra some form of identifying jewelry, so that it may more clearly express its superiority over all lesser creatures. It serves its master as an equal, subservient only to their wishes by the fact of the magic binding them rather than any true loyalty. The oath of a snake means little, except when it is made to the ruler of the Endless Empire."

They glow with radiant power in the darkness of the night, and drive back the shadows that would hide the lost artifacts and rituals needed to complete their task. These shards are singleminded in their quest, and cannot be turned aside by danger. When their charge is threatened, they willingly sacrifice themselves as the Exile was willing to, seeking to save their fallen comrade at the cost of their own lives. They still bear that spark of scorn for mortality that their originator once held, however, and strike with malevolent light whenever they witness the fall of a mortal foe. Summoning a luminous shard is fairly simple, by comparison to some of the other familiars. One must simply stand before the brazier, ignite it, and speak passionately about something they desire or something they have lost. The tongues of flame will begin to burn a warm blue and gold while moving together into a humanoid figure. The summoner must then gently offer a hand, and assist the tiny entity out of the brazier. As it exits, it will solidify into a luminous shard. The summoner must then declare their purpose in life, as they see it at that moment. If they are truthful, then the shard will swear loyalty in a series of gestures and serve faithfully as a familiar from then on. If they are deceptive, then the shard will shed a tear of molten crystal, shatter into fragments, and rejoin the Exile in the skies above."

They can also use this light for more mundane purposes, creating murals and inscriptions of things that they have recorded, or simply displaying what they have witnessed and heard. This makes them invaluable to justiciars, as they can display evidence of wrongdoing that is inalterable and unquestionable.",

Oddly enough, they seem to prefer being exposed to a constant onslaught of sound when at rest, and will seek out the noisiest place around to build their nests.",

They enjoy gifts of fruit and shiny objects, which they use to build elaborate nests. Their songs are legendary for leading travelers astray, however, and they are often viewed with mistrust and suspicion by folk in less civilized lands. Summoning a symphonic songbird involves singing, as one might expect. The brazier is lit, the incense is burned, and the summoner must begin a melody of their own creation. It must be carefully done, so that there is room for another to harmonize without interruption or disruption, and is often difficult for novices. Once the song reaches the correct moment, the fire within the brazier will coalesce into the image of a songbird, and it will begin to sing along with its new master. The summoner must continue their song to an appropriate closing, guiding the bird out from the brazier at the same time. Once it has emerged fully and is corporeal, the warlock must end the song and speak their name. The symphonic songbird will repeat the name perfectly, and then speak its own. When the warlock does the same and speaks the songbird's name in exact mimicry, the bond between familiar and master will be formed."

						"A deadly thing that lurks in the pockets of countless saints and villains alike, money is a tool that brings both salvation and misery. Not all funds can be trusted, however. The Currency Conspiracy has been gradually replacing the original currencies of the world with karensee, colloquially known as wealth mimics. They can take an endless number of forms, but they are restricted, unlike their larger kin. These mimics can only choose to turn into objects that appear to be of value. A gold coin, a bill, a gemstone, a necklace of pearls: all of these things are potential wealth mimics. Most of them are asleep, trapped in a singular form. They feign damage or other ill effects while they are sleeping, behaving exactly like natural materials. However, when they are awakened by eldritch magic, they come to life and attack those who sought to own them. Members of the Currency conspiracy often call and awaken wealth mimics using a ritualistic rite, but any warlock of sufficient power and knowledge can summon one.",
						"The first steps are relatively easy. The summoner must ignite the brazier and stand adjacent to it, speaking the correct incantations. Once the fire has burned down to embers, the summoner must insert a single object of value that a wealth mimic could imitate, such as a coin or bank note.",
						"Next, the warlock must offer blood. When a few drops are applied to the object within the brazier, the flames will flare to life once more, consuming the object and then disappearing. The ashes will begin to form together into a shape identical to that of the object, and a new wealth mimic will be born. It will speak a single word, giving itself a name. So long as that name is known by its master, it will obey perfectly, changing shape and killing on command.",
						"Wealth mimics enjoy being fed other currency. Some scholars whisper that this is intended to give them power, but others suspect that they are simply innately cannibalistic. Those in the Conspiracy are believed to have created the wealth mimics with a built-in safety measure, in case something goes wrong with the final plan. In that instance, they would consume one another in a frenzy after being deprived of other flesh, rendering them harmless to those they could not reach."

Against foes smaller than itself, the cube will rush them and attempt to engulf and consume them. They speak to the minds around them with a childlike innocence even as they feast on dead mortals and beasts alike.
